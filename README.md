# PredictBNB - Gaming Oracle Infrastructure
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
> **A decentralized gaming oracle for on-chain prediction markets on BNB Chain**

PredictBNB is a specialized oracle network for gaming results that enables game developers to monetize their data while providing prediction markets with fast, verified game outcomes.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Current prediction market oracles (like UMA's Optimistic Oracle) face challenges:

- **Slow resolution**: 24-48 hours for UMA OO vs our **15-30 minutes**
- **Generic infrastructure**: Not optimized for gaming data
- **No developer incentives**: Game devs don't benefit from being data providers
- **High vulnerability**: Low-liquidity markets are easily manipulated

## 💡 Our Solution

PredictBNB creates a **domain-specific oracle for gaming** with:

1. ⚡ **Fast Finality**: 15-30 minute dispute window (vs 24-48h for UMA)
2. 🎮 **Gaming-Specific**: Built for esports and competitive gaming from day one
3. 💰 **Developer Monetization**: Game devs earn fees as their data is consumed
4. 🔒 **Stake-Based Security**: Developers stake tokens, slashed for fraud
5. 🆓 **Adoption-Friendly**: Free tier (50 queries/day) + prepaid balance with volume bonuses (5-15%)

## 📊 Token Economics

### Revenue Split (Per Query)
```
Each Query: 0.003 BNB ($1.80 @ $600/BNB)
├── 80% (0.0024 BNB = $1.44) → Game Developer (whose match was queried)
├── 15% (0.00045 BNB = $0.27) → Protocol Treasury
└── 5% (0.00015 BNB = $0.09) → Disputer Pool
```

**KEY FEATURE**: Game developers earn per query to THEIR games - popular games earn more!

### Prepaid Balance with Volume Bonuses

Users deposit funds once and get bonus credits for larger deposits:

| Deposit Amount | Bonus | Total Credit | Effective Cost/Query | Queries Enabled |
|----------------|-------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **1-9.99 BNB** | 0% | Deposit | $1.80 | 333-3,333 |
| **10-49.99 BNB** | **5%** | Deposit × 1.05 | **$1.71** | 3,500-17,499 |
| **50-99.99 BNB** | **10%** | Deposit × 1.10 | **$1.64** | 18,333-36,666 |
| **100+ BNB** | **15%** | Deposit × 1.15 | **$1.57** | 38,333+ |

**Example**: Deposit 100 BNB ($60,000) → Receive 115 BNB credit → 38,333 queries @ $1.57 each

### Benefits of Prepaid Model

✅ **Gas Efficient**: One deposit for thousands of queries (97% gas savings!)
✅ **Volume Discounts**: Save 5-15% on larger deposits
✅ **No Lock-in**: Withdraw unused balance anytime
✅ **Fair to Developers**: Popular games earn more (usage-based)
✅ **Free Tier**: 50 queries/day for testing

### Developer Revenue Potential (Usage-Based)

**Game developers earn $1.44 per query to THEIR game** - fair, transparent, scalable:

| Game Type | Monthly Queries | Monthly Revenue (@ $1.44/query) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Niche/New Game** | 10,000 | **$14,400** 💰 |
| **Growing Game** | 100,000 | **$144,000** 💰 |
| **Popular Game** | 1,000,000 | **$1,440,000** 💰💰 |
| **Major Esports Title** | 10,000,000 | **$14,400,000** 💰💰💰 |
| **Top 3 Esports** | 50,000,000 | **$72,000,000** 💰💰💰 |

**Why this model is perfect:**
- ✅ Fair: Popular games earn more (as they should!)
- ✅ Motivating: Build better games → More queries → More revenue
- ✅ Passive: Onchain games auto-earn without any action
- ✅ Scalable: Revenue grows automatically with success
- ✅ Predictable: Simple formula: Queries × $1.44 = Monthly Revenue

## 🎮 Integration Guide

### For Game Developers

```solidity
// 1. Register your game
await gameRegistry.registerGame(
  "your-game-id",
  "Your Game Name",
  GameType.MOBA, // or FPS, Sports, etc.
  { value: ethers.parseEther("0.1") }
);

// 2. Schedule matches
const matchId = await gameRegistry.scheduleMatch(
  "your-game-id",
  "match-123",
  futureTimestamp,
  JSON.stringify({ team1: "TSM", team2: "C9" })
);

// 3. Submit results after match
await oracleCore.submitResult(
  matchId,
  JSON.stringify({ winner: "TSM", score: "2-1" })
);

// 4. Withdraw earnings
await feeManager.withdrawRevenue();
```

### For Prediction Markets

```solidity
// 1. Register as consumer
await feeManager.registerConsumer();

// 2. Deposit balance with volume bonus
await feeManager.depositBalance({ value: ethers.parseEther("50") });
// Depositing 50 BNB gets you 55 BNB credit (10% bonus!)
// This enables 18,333 queries @ $1.64 each

// 3. Check your balance
const balance = await feeManager.getConsumerBalance(yourAddress);
const freeQueries = await feeManager.getRemainingFreeQueries(yourAddress);

// 4. Query results (automatically deducts from balance)
const [resultData, resultHash, isFinalized] = await feeManager.queryResult(matchId);
// No payment needed per query! Deducted from prepaid balance
// Game developer earns $1.44 immediately

// 5. Use result data to resolve markets
const result = JSON.parse(resultData);
// Resolve betting market based on result

// 6. (Optional) Withdraw unused balance later
await feeManager.withdrawBalance(ethers.parseEther("10"));
```
