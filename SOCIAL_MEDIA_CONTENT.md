### Problem Statement Thread

**Tweet 1:**
```
🎯 The Problem with Gaming Prediction Markets:

Oracles are expensive, slow, and not built for gaming.

Let me explain why this matters 🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
1/ Cost Problem 💸

Chainlink charges 0.4 LINK (~$5-6) per query

For a prediction market making $2-5K per match, that's still expensive when you need 100s of queries

We need cheaper infrastructure
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
2/ Speed Problem ⏱️

UMA disputes take 24-48 hours to resolve

Gaming markets need FAST resolution

Bettors won't wait 2 days for payouts

Current solutions aren't built for gaming speed
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
3/ Data Problem 📊

Generic oracles return raw JSON

No gaming-specific schemas
No typed data structures
No validation for esports data

Developers build the same parsing logic over and over
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
4/ Solution: PredictBNB 🎮⚡

✅ $1.80/query (70% cheaper)
⚡ 15-minute disputes (96x faster)
🎯 Gaming-specific schemas
💰 80% revenue to game devs
🔧 20% gas optimized

Built specifically for gaming prediction markets on @BNBCHAIN

**Gas Optimization:**
```
⚡ Gas Optimization Deep Dive

PredictBNB saves 20% on gas costs through:

🔹 Custom errors (saves 50-100 gas/revert)
🔹 Immutable variables (saves 2,100 gas/access)
🔹 Bitmap packing (saves 80,000 gas/write)
🔹 Optimized structs (45% storage reduction)

Every wei counts on-chain 💰
